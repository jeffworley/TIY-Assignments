	// Your starting point. Enjoy the ride!
	// It appears that the application is set up structure wise through it's HTML file.  It's general outline is such that you have a title of todo and then a list of things that you need to complete below.  Each item (there are only two completed right now) has a 'checked' button to inidicate completion.  There are also two that can be edited but who do not have working 'checked' buttons.
	//I did not see any css files that we could review but did see two referenced in the 'link' tags.  It does not look as though any noticable stylings or layout adjustments have been made.
	//I also believe that this is the js file that will improve the functionality.  All functionality I see currently is default HTML tags.
